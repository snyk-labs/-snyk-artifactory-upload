Copy Operation Test Cases:
- Verify successful upload of Snyk vulnerability report file to specified directory.
- Test with different valid and invalid paths for the Snyk vulnerability report file.
- Ensure graceful handling of errors when specified directory is inaccessible or doesn't exist.

Process Operation Test Cases:
- Verify correct retrieval of Snyk vulnerability report file from specified directory.
- Test with various valid and invalid paths for the Snyk vulnerability report file.
- Ensure proper processing of retrieved report file.
- Test with different types of artifact specifications (URLs or build details).

CopyAndProcess Operation Test Cases:
- Verify successful copying of Snyk vulnerability report file and its processing.
- Test with different combinations of artifact specification methods (URLs or build details).
- Ensure correct setting of properties on designated Artifactory artifacts based on Snyk report.
- Test cases to ensure proper setting of properties such as scan status, findings present, severity levels, counts, and project link.

Artifact Specification Test Cases:
- Test with a single valid artifact URL.
- Test with multiple valid artifact URLs separated by configured delimiter.
- Ensure graceful handling of invalid URLs.
- Verify correct processing of artifacts specified by build details (build name, number, and project name).

Edge Cases and Error Handling:
- Test with edge cases such as empty input fields or unexpected input formats.
- Verify error handling for scenarios like invalid service connections, missing required parameters, or network failures during file transfer.
- Test with large Snyk vulnerability report files to ensure performance and resource handling.
- Ensure proper handling when no Snyk findings are present in the report.
